<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Kizito Chukwude — a full stack developer and behavioral scientist 
  who builds technology that's not just functional, but intuitive and human-centered.
   I specialize in creating digital experiences that align with how people think, decide, and 
   interact. Every project I take on is a chance to blend solid engineering with deep behavioral
    insights, crafting solutions that are as smart as they are practical.</p>

<p>Technically, I work across the stack —  JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python — 
  building scalable systems, clean interfaces, and smooth user experiences.
   But I don't just ship code; I design for behavior. I think about what users expect, 
   where they hesitate, and how to make every interaction feel natural. 
   My process is grounded in research, data, and hands-on testing, 
   aiming for products that don’t just work — they stick.</p>

<p>I'm always building, learning, and refining. 
  Whether it’s launching a new app, experimenting with UX flows, or diving into 
  cognitive science research, I stay focused on growth and real-world impact. 
  The projects you’ll find here reflect that mindset: crafted with care, driven by curiosity, 
  and built to last.</p>
